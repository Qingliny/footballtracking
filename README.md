# footballtracking
Thegoalofthisprojectistoprocesshigh-definition soccer footage (video clip from Youtube as the dataset for this project) in order to detect and track the locations of both the football and players, with the ultimate goal of automatically computing the number of passes which occur and the occupied rate of ball (the ratio of number of passes of one team to total number of passes for both teams) for each team. We are going to select some footage as our test footage which will include both stationary kicking and kicking that occurs when the intended receiver is in motion. Taking into consideration current advancements of digital image processing techniques, We are going to use MATLAB image processing methodology detailed below.
